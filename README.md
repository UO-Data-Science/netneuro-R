# netneuro-R

**Prerequisites** These tutorials will use RStudio. You'll need to install it along with R, see [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) for instructions.

## Getting the Files Data in this Package
* **Option 1** The easiest way is to use the git and the command line to checkout this repository
 
   ```git clone https://github.com/UO-Data-Science/netneuro-R.git```
  
* **Option 2** Download the data and R markdown files from github
  * Step 1: Click on the file you would like to download in github, which should open a preview of it
  * Step 2: In bar above the file preview there is a download button that will let you save the files wherever you want on your computer

## Running Examples
* Each of the examples below has an RMarkdown file and potentially some data files. See more information [here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html)
* RMarkdown creates html, pdfs, or others file types by 'kniting' your code into html or pdfs
* To knit each example look for the knit button in RStudio and press it

### Trouble Shooting
* All RMarkdown files are intended to run with the working directory set to the same folder as the markdown file. You can do this by clicking the **To Source File Location** button
