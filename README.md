   ```git clone https://github.com/UO-Data-Science/netneuro-R.git```
 
* **Option 2:** Download the data and R markdown files from GitHub:
  1. Click on the file you wish to download in GitHub. This action should open a preview of the file.
  2. Above the file preview, there's a download button which allows you to save the files to your preferred location on your computer.

## Running Examples
* Each example provided below includes an RMarkdown file, and some may have accompanying data files. For more details on RMarkdown, click [here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html).
